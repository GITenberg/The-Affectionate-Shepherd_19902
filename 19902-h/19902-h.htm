<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Two copies only of the poem by Barnfield here reprinted, are known to be
preserved; one in Sion College Library, and another, formerly in Heber's
possession, mentioned in "Bibliotheca Heberiana," iv. 15. Its merits and
great rarity have pointed it out as a work deserving to be more known
and appreciated. Barnfield is, perhaps, chiefly remembered by his
elegant pieces printed in the "Passionate Pilgrim," attributed by some
to Shakespeare; but Mr. Collier has distinctly proved them to belong to
the less eminent poet. The "Affectionate Shepherd" was his first
production, as he himself confesses in the preface to his "Cynthia,"
1595, and it has received the well-merited commendation of Warton.
Besides these poems, he is the author of "The Complaint of Poetrie for
the death of Liberalitie," 4to. 1598, and others published at the same
time, reprints of which are in the British Museum; also "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> Encomium
of Lady Pecunia, or the Praise of Money," a curious manuscript in the
Ashmolean Museum, and likewise printed in the author's life-time. It
should be mentioned that in the original copies of the following tract
are a few hexameter verses on the Rape of Helen, which have been omitted
as of an inferior kind to the other part of the work, and for still more
obvious reasons. The "Affectionate Shepherd" itself will be found
remarkably free from the coarseness which disfigures so much of the
Elizabethan literature,&mdash;an additional inducement, if any were
necessary, for rescuing it from the liability to destruction which is of
course incident to any book of such excessive rarity. Our thanks are due
to the Rev. H. Christmas, Librarian of Sion College, for the courtesy
and liberality with which he permitted our transcript to be made from a
volume of tracts possessing the greatest charm for the bibliographer;
for besides the present one, it contains the first edition of
Shakespeare's Lucrece, and several other pieces of nearly equal value,
in the finest possible condition.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Scarce had the morning starre hid from the light<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heavens crimson canopie with stars bespangled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I began to rue th' unhappy sight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of that faire boy that had my hart intangled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cursing the time, the place, the sense, the sin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came, I saw, I viewd, I slipped in.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If it be sinne to love a sweet-fac'd boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose amber locks trust up in golden tramels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dangle adowne his lovely cheekes with joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When pearle and flowers his faire haire enamels;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it be sinne to love a lovely lad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh then sinne I, for whom my soule is sad.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His ivory-white and alablaster skin<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is staind throughout with rare vermillion red,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whose twinckling starrie lights doe never blin<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To shine on lovely Venus, Beauties bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as the lillie and the blushing rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So white and red on him in order growes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Upon a time the nymphs bestird them-selves<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To trie who could his beautie soonest win;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he accounted them but all as elves,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Except it were the faire Queene Guendolen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her he embrac'd, of her was beloved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With plaints he proved, and with teares he moved.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But her an old man had beene sutor too,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That in his age began to doate againe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her would he often pray, and often woo,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When through old age enfeebled was his braine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she before had lov'd a lustie youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That now was dead, the cause of all her ruth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thus it hapned, Death and Cupid met<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon a time at swilling Bacchus house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where daintie cates upon the boord were set,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And goblets full of wine to drinke carouse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Love and Death did love the licor so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That out they fall and to the fray they goe.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And having both their quivers at their backe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fild full of arrows; th' one of fatall steele,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other all of gold; Deaths shaft was black,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Loves was yellow: Fortune turnd her wheele,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And from Deaths quiver fell a fatall shaft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That under Cupid by the winde was waft.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And at the same time by ill hap there fell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Another arrow out of Cupids quiver,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The which was carried by the winde at will,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And under Death the amorous shaft did shiver:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They being parted, Love tooke up Deaths dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Death tooke up Loves arrow for his part.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus as they wandred both about the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At last Death met with one of feeble age:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith he drew a shaft and at him hurld<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The unknowne arrow with a furious rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking to strike him dead with Deaths blacke dart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he, alas, with Love did wound his hart!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This was the doting foole, this was the man<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That lov'd faire Guendolena, Queene of Beautie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shee cannot shake him off, doo what she can,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For he hath vowd to her his soules last duety:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making him trim upon the holydaies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crownes his love with garlands made of baies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now doth he stroke his beard, and now againe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He wipes the drivel from his filthy chin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now offers he a kisse, but high Disdaine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will not permit her hart to pity him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hart more hard than adamant or steele,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hart more changeable than Fortunes wheele.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But leave we him in love up to the eares,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And tell how Love behav'd himselfe abroad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who seeing one that mourned still in teares,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A young man groaning under Loves great load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking to ease his burden, rid his paines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For men have griefe as long as life remaines.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas, the while that unawares he drue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fatall shaft that Death had dropt before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which deceit great harme did then insue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stayning his face with blood and filthy goare:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face, that was to Guendolen more deere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than love of lords, or any lordly peere.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This was that faire and beautifull young man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whom Guendolena so lamented for;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is that Love whom she doth curse and ban,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Because she doth that dismall chaunce abhor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if it were not for his mothers sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even Ganimede himselfe she would forsake.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh would shee would forsake my Ganimede,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose sugred love is full of sweete delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon whose forehead you may plainely reade<br /></span>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
